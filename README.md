# Food-Image-Classification
Effects of Parameter Averaging and Model Ensembling on the Accuracy of Food Image Classification: Food is essential for our lives. With the onset of
the internet, every day thousands of photos of food are shared
daily over social media platforms worldwide. From individuals
posting photos of their meals to food bloggers and critics sharing
their images on their websites and social media to a global
audience, food images make up a vast portion of media found
on the internet. Therefore correct identification of differences is
essential for advertisers looking to advertise their content based
on individual preference. The wrong classification of food images
results in advertisers missing out on their target audience as
well as health-conscious people being unable to check important
details like calorie intake and ingredients. Nowadays, AI and
image recognition are making it easier to correctly identify food
images, with researchers finding various methods to do this
more accurately and efficiently. In our experiment, we tried
to develop a technique that is able to provide more accurate
results using our limited resources and models. We experimented
with techniques like model ensemble and parameter averaging
to get a list of values showing accuracy. We trained 74 models
and 15 different combinations. While training single models
and averaging the parameter, accuracy increased in 75% of the
models. Furthermore, 11 out of 15 combinations had a greater
accuracy, including the averaging parameter technique. Hence
73.33% combinations had improved accuracy. The combination
of InceptionV3, Resnet50, and VGG16 models using the average
ensemble technique and average parameters had the highest
accuracy of 95.24%.
